# Screen Connect
Enabling users to connect mobile devices as a controller to a larger display screen via QR code scanning.

## Terminology
**Display** -- The main screen (typically a large screen or monitor) that shows the primary content and shows a QR code to allow mobile devices to connect

**Controller** -- Mobile devices (phones, tablets) that scan the QR code to connect and interact with the display

The repository contains both frontend applications and backend services for:
- Display frontend (web application for the main screen)
- Controller frontend (web application for mobile devices)
- Backend API endpoints for real-time communication between displays and controllers
